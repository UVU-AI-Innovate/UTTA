# Getting Started with UTTA

Welcome to the Universal Teaching and Training Assistant (UTTA) framework! This guide will help you get started with using UTTA for your educational AI applications.

## What is UTTA?

UTTA is a framework designed to help educators, trainers, and instructional designers leverage AI in teaching and training environments. It provides tools and components for creating AI-powered educational experiences, such as:

- Interactive learning assistants
- Automated grading and feedback systems
- Content generation for educational materials
- Personalized learning experiences

## Quick Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Python 3.10 or newer
- pip or conda package manager

Install UTTA using pip:

```bash
pip install utta
```

For development setup, see our [Environment Setup](Environment-Setup) guide.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from utta import Assistant

# Create an assistant for a specific subject
math_assistant = Assistant(subject="mathematics")

# Get a response to a student's question
response = math_assistant.answer("How do I solve quadratic equations?")
print(response)
```

## Framework Components

UTTA consists of several core components:

1. **Assistant**: The main interface for creating AI teaching assistants
2. **ContentGenerator**: For creating educational content and materials
3. **FeedbackEngine**: For providing automated feedback on student work
4. **KnowledgeBase**: For storing and retrieving domain-specific knowledge
5. **PersonalizationEngine**: For customizing learning experiences
