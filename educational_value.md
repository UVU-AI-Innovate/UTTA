# Educational Value of LLM Fine-Tuning Examples

These fine-tuning example files provide significant educational value for students learning about LLM adaptation techniques:

## 1. Conceptual Understanding

The `simple_example.py` script serves as an excellent introduction to the three fine-tuning approaches. It gives students:
- Clear comparisons between the methods
- Visual examples of teacher-student dialogues
- Detailed characteristics of each approach
- No complex dependencies to run

## 2. Code Structure Analysis

Even without running them, the detailed example scripts (`dspy_example.py`, `openai_finetune.py`, `huggingface_lora.py`) provide:
- Real implementation patterns for each approach
- Detailed comments explaining the code
- Dataset preparation techniques
- Evaluation methodologies

## 3. Pedagogical Techniques

The examples demonstrate various teaching techniques:
- Socratic questioning (asking follow-up questions)
- Scaffolding (breaking complex topics into manageable parts)
- Misconception addressing (identifying and correcting errors)
- Context maintenance (remembering previous dialogue turns)

## 4. Applied Learning

The assignment structure encourages students to:
- Create their own dialogue datasets
- Design implementation strategies
- Compare approaches critically
- Apply the techniques to real educational scenarios

## 5. Technical Skills Development

Students develop skills in:
- Prompt engineering
- Dataset preparation for LLM fine-tuning
- Model evaluation
- Cost-benefit analysis
- System design for conversational AI

The focus on reviewing and adapting the code, rather than simply running it, ensures students develop a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and implementation details.
