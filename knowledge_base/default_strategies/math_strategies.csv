place_value,"confusion with tens and ones, difficulty with larger numbers, place value misconceptions","use base-10 blocks, create place value charts, use number lines","show 23 as 2 tens and 3 ones, display numbers with expanded notation"
regrouping,"forgetting to carry over, errors in the procedure, confusion with borrowing","draw place value chart, use manipulatives, connect to real-world examples","38+45: show regrouping 8+5, demonstrate with money (dimes and pennies)"
word_problems,"difficulty identifying operation, reading comprehension barriers, translating words to numbers","highlight key words, teach problem-solving frameworks, use visual representations","'altogether' means addition, draw bar models, create step-by-step checklists"
mental_math,"counting on fingers, inefficient strategies, lack of number sense","teach number bonds, practice fact families, use ten-frames","know 7+3=10 for 7+5, use doubles (6+6=12 so 6+7=13)"
number_patterns,"missing sequence steps, difficulty recognizing patterns, trouble extending patterns","use visual patterns, create kinesthetic sequences, connect to real life","show growing pattern with blocks, create movement patterns (clap, stomp, clap)"
fractions,"confusion with numerator/denominator, improper fractions misunderstanding, equivalent fractions","use fraction manipulatives, draw visual models, connect to everyday context","use pizza models for fractions, fold paper to show equivalence"
measurement,"unit conversion errors, choosing appropriate units, estimation difficulties","provide hands-on measuring experiences, connect to benchmarks, create conversion charts","measure classroom objects, relate meter to body height, create reference cards"
geometry,"shape classification errors, property misconceptions, spatial reasoning challenges","use physical shape manipulatives, implement shape sorting activities, explore 3D objects","identify shapes in the environment, build 3D structures, play shape identification games"
data_analysis,"misinterpreting graphs, scale errors, difficulty organizing data","collect meaningful classroom data, create student-generated graphs, analyze real-world statistics","track daily temperature, survey student preferences, interpret simple news graphs"
problem_solving,"rush to answer, single strategy fixation, giving up too quickly","teach multiple strategies explicitly, model thinking aloud, encourage persistence","try drawing it out, work backward, look for patterns, check reasonableness of answer"
