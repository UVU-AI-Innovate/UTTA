);

CREATE TABLE embeddings (
    chunk_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    vector BLOB,                   -- Binary vector representation (384 dimensions)
    FOREIGN KEY (chunk_id) REFERENCES chunks(id)
);
```

The secondary database (`knowledge.db`) contains structured behavioral data with the following tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,          -- Short behavioral content
    source TEXT,           -- Source file
    type TEXT,             -- Content type (structured/unstructured)

## Knowledge Processing Pipeline

### 1. Content Acquisition

Educational materials are collected in various formats:
- **PDF textbooks**: Academic textbooks and guides
- **DOCX documents**: Teaching resources and lesson plans
- **TXT files**: Research papers and articles
- **JSON/JSONL**: Structured behavioral data

### 2. Document Processing

#### Text Extraction

The system uses format-specific processors to extract text from various document types:

1. **PDF Processing**:
   - **Primary Method**: PyMuPDF (MuPDF wrapper)
     ```python
     import fitz  # PyMuPDF
     with fitz.open(filepath) as pdf:
         text = ""
         for page in pdf:
             text += page.get_text()
     ```
   - **Fallback Method**: PyPDF2
     ```python
     import PyPDF2
     with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:
         reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
         text = ""
         for page in reader.pages:
             text += page.extract_text()
     ```

2. **DOCX Processing**:
   - Uses python-docx library
     ```python
     import docx
     doc = docx.Document(filepath)
     text = "\n".join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])
     ```

3. **TXT Processing**:
   - Direct text reading
     ```python
     with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
         text = file.read()
     ```

4. **JSON Processing**:
   - Extracts structured content
     ```python
     import json
     with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
         data = json.load(file)
         # Extract text from various fields
     ```

#### Text Chunking

The system breaks long texts into manageable chunks for processing:

1. **Approach**: Word-based chunking with overlap
   ```python
   def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=500, overlap=50):
       words = text.split()
       words_per_chunk = chunk_size // 6  # Approximate words per chunk
       overlap_words = overlap // 6       # Words to overlap
       
       chunks = []
       for i in range(0, len(words), words_per_chunk - overlap_words):
           end = min(i + words_per_chunk, len(words))
           chunk = " ".join(words[i:end])
           chunks.append({
               "text": chunk,
               "start_word": i,
               "end_word": end,
               "position": len(chunks)
           })
       return chunks
   ```

2. **Metadata Preservation**: Each chunk maintains connection to its source
   ```python
   chunk_metadata = {
       "source": document_name,
       "title": document_title,
       "author": document_author,
       "section": section_name,
       "position": chunk_position
   }
   ```

#### Content Categorization

The system automatically assigns each chunk to a category using keyword-based classification:

```python
def categorize_chunk(text):
    text = text.lower()
    
    if any(term in text for term in ["classroom management", "behavior", "discipline"]):
        return "classroom_management"
        
    elif any(term in text for term in ["strategy", "teaching method", "instruction"]):
        return "teaching_strategies"
        
    elif any(term in text for term in ["development", "learning style", "cognitive"]):
        return "student_development"
        
    else:
        return "general_education"
```

### 3. Vector Embedding

#### Embedding Generation

The system converts text chunks into numerical vector representations:

1. **Model**: Uses sentence-transformers with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   embeddings = model.encode(chunks, batch_size=32)
   ```

2. **Vector Properties**:
   - Each chunk becomes a 384-dimensional vector
   - Embedding size: ~1.5KB per chunk
   - Normalized for cosine similarity search

3. **Batch Processing**:
   ```python
   batch_size = 32
   all_embeddings = []
   
   for i in range(0, len(all_chunks), batch_size):
       batch = all_chunks[i:i+batch_size]
       embeddings = model.encode(batch)
       all_embeddings.append(embeddings)
       
   # Combine all batches
   embeddings = np.vstack(all_embeddings)
   
   # Normalize for cosine similarity
   faiss.normalize_L2(embeddings)
   ```

#### Database Storage

The system efficiently stores vectors in SQLite:

1. **Binary Vector Storage**:
   ```python
   # Prepare vectors for storage
   for i, vector in enumerate(embeddings):
       chunk_id = chunk_ids[i]
       # Convert numpy array to binary blob
       vector_blob = vector.tobytes()
       cursor.execute('INSERT INTO embeddings (chunk_id, vector) VALUES (?, ?)',
                    (chunk_id, vector_blob))
   ```

2. **Metadata JSON Storage**:
   ```python
   metadata_json = json.dumps(chunk["metadata"])
   cursor.execute(
       'INSERT INTO chunks (text, metadata, category) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
       (chunk["text"], metadata_json, category)
   )
   ```

### 4. Knowledge Retrieval

The system implements efficient semantic search to find relevant content:

1. **Query Processing**:
   ```python
   def search(query, top_k=5):
       # Convert query to embedding
       query_embedding = model.encode([query])
       faiss.normalize_L2(query_embedding)
       
       # Load vectors from database
       vectors = load_vectors_from_db()
       
       # Create FAISS index
       index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(384)  # Inner product (cosine similarity)
       index.add(vectors)
       
       # Search
       distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
       
       # Retrieve corresponding chunks
       results = []
       for i, idx in enumerate(indices[0]):
           chunk = get_chunk_by_id(idx)
           results.append({
               "text": chunk["text"],
               "metadata": chunk["metadata"],
               "similarity": float(distances[0][i])
           })
       
       return results
   ```

2. **SQLite Vector Search**:
   ```python
   def search_db(query, top_k=5):
       # Convert query to embedding
       query_embedding = model.encode([query])[0]
       
       # Retrieve all vectors
       cursor.execute("SELECT chunk_id, vector FROM embeddings")
       results = cursor.fetchall()
       
       # Compute similarities
       similarities = []
       for chunk_id, vector_blob in results:
           vector = np.frombuffer(vector_blob, dtype=np.float32)
           similarity = np.dot(query_embedding, vector)
           similarities.append((chunk_id, similarity))
       
       # Sort and get top k
       similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
       top_results = similarities[:top_k]
       
       # Get chunk data
       chunks = []
       for chunk_id, similarity in top_results:
           cursor.execute("SELECT text, metadata, category FROM chunks WHERE id = ?", 
                         (chunk_id,))
           text, metadata_json, category = cursor.fetchone()
           metadata = json.loads(metadata_json)
           chunks.append({
               "id": chunk_id,
               "text": text,
               "metadata": metadata,
               "category": category,
               "similarity": similarity
           })
       
       return chunks
   ```

## Vector Store Implementation

### FAISS Integration

The system originally used Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) for efficient vector search:

1. **Index Types**:
   - Small datasets (<10K chunks): `IDMap,Flat` - Exact search, highest quality
   - Large datasets (>10K chunks): `IVF100,PQ8` - Approximate search, better scalability

2. **Index Creation**:
   ```python
   dimension = 384  # Vector dimension
   
   if len(chunks) < 10000:
       # Simple index for smaller datasets (higher quality)
       index = faiss.IndexIDMap(faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension))
   else:
       # IVF with Product Quantization for larger datasets
       quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension)
       index = faiss.IndexIVFPQ(quantizer, dimension, 100, 8, 8)
       index.train(embeddings)
   
   # Add vectors to index with IDs
   ids = np.arange(len(chunks), dtype=np.int64)
   index.add_with_ids(embeddings, ids)
   ```

3. **Index Saving/Loading**:
   ```python
   # Save index
   faiss.write_index(index, index_output_path)
   
   # Load index
   index = faiss.read_index(index_path)
   ```

### SQLite Vector Storage

The system now uses SQLite for vector storage, offering better integration with metadata:

1. **Advantages**:
   - Single database for vectors and metadata
   - Transactional safety
   - Familiar SQL query language
   - Easy backup and version control

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Indices on frequently queried fields
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_category ON chunks(category);
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_usage ON chunks(usage_count);
   CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_effectiveness ON chunks(effectiveness_score);
   ```
   
   - Prepared statements for common operations
   ```python
   insert_chunk_stmt = conn.prepare(
       "INSERT INTO chunks (text, metadata, category) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
   )
   ```

3. **Vector Search Implementation**:
   - In-memory vector loading for search operations
   - Batch processing for efficiency
   - Early termination for time-sensitive operations

## LLM Integration

### Knowledge-Enhanced LLM Interactions

The system integrates the knowledge base with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent, evidence-based interactions:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval Process**:
   ```python
   def generate_enhanced_response(query, context):
       # 1. Retrieve relevant knowledge
       knowledge_chunks = vector_db.search(query, top_k=3)
       
       # 2. Format knowledge for LLM context
       knowledge_context = "\n\n".join([chunk["text"] for chunk in knowledge_chunks])
       
       # 3. Create enhanced prompt with knowledge
       prompt = f"""
       Use the following educational knowledge to answer:
       
       EDUCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE:
       {knowledge_context}
       
       CONTEXT:
       {context}
       
       QUERY:
       {query}
       """
       
       # 4. Generate response using LLM
       response = llm.generate(prompt)
       
       # 5. Track which knowledge was used
       for chunk in knowledge_chunks:
           vector_db.update_usage(chunk["id"])
       
       return {
           "response": response,
           "knowledge_sources": [
               {"id": chunk["id"], "source": chunk["metadata"]["source"]}
               for chunk in knowledge_chunks
           ]
       }
   ```

2. **LLM Provider Integration**:
   - Compatible with various LLMs:
     - **Local**: Ollama, llama.cpp
     - **API-based**: OpenAI, Anthropic, AI21

3. **Context Window Management**:
   - Selective knowledge inclusion based on relevance
   - Compression of knowledge for longer contexts
   - Dynamic token counting to maximize context utilization

### Scenario Generation with LLMs

The system uses knowledge-augmented LLMs to create realistic classroom scenarios:

```python
def generate_scenario(grade_level, subject, challenge_type):
    # Build search query based on parameters
    query = f"classroom management {challenge_type} for {grade_level} education"
    if subject:
        query += f" during {subject} lessons"
        
    # Retrieve relevant knowledge
    knowledge_chunks = vector_db.search(query, category="classroom_management", top_k=3)
    knowledge_context = "\n\n".join([chunk["text"] for chunk in knowledge_chunks])
    
    # Create prompt with knowledge
    prompt = f"""
    Use the following educational knowledge to create a realistic classroom 
    management scenario for {grade_level} teachers:
    
    EDUCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE:
    {knowledge_context}
    
    Create a detailed classroom scenario that includes:
    1. Student behavior challenge in a {grade_level} classroom.
    2. Classroom context and environment.
    3. Previous interventions if any
    4. Learning objectives that are being impacted
    5. Student background information relevant to the situation
    
    FORMAT:
    Provide the scenario as a narrative paragraph that a teacher would encounter.
    """
    
    # Generate scenario using LLM
    scenario_text = llm.generate(prompt)
    
    # Return scenario with knowledge references
    return {
        "scenario": scenario_text,
        "knowledge_sources": [
            {
                "id": chunk["id"],
                "source": chunk["metadata"]["source"],
                "section": chunk["metadata"].get("section", ""),
                "similarity": chunk.get("similarity", 0)
            } for chunk in knowledge_chunks
        ],
        "parameters": {
            "grade_level": grade_level,
            "subject": subject,
            "challenge_type": challenge_type
        }
    }
```

### Response Evaluation

The system uses knowledge-based evaluation of teacher responses:

```python
def evaluate_response(teacher_response, scenario, knowledge_chunks):
    # Create evaluation prompt using knowledge
    knowledge_context = "\n\n".join([chunk["text"] for chunk in knowledge_chunks])
    
    evaluation_prompt = f"""
    Use the following educational knowledge to evaluate this teacher response to a classroom management scenario:
    
    EDUCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE:
    {knowledge_context}
    
    SCENARIO:
    {scenario["scenario"]}
    
    TEACHER RESPONSE:
    {teacher_response}
    
    Evaluate the response based on best practices in classroom management. Provide:
    1. Effectiveness score (0-1)
    2. Strengths of the response (at least 2-3 points)
    3. Areas for improvement (if any)
    4. Alternative approaches based on the knowledge
    
    FORMAT:
    Provide the evaluation in clear sections with headers.
    """
    
    # Generate evaluation using LLM
    evaluation = llm.generate(evaluation_prompt)
    
    # Update effectiveness scores for used knowledge
    for chunk in knowledge_chunks:
        # Parse the effectiveness score from the evaluation
        # This could be improved with structured output from the LLM
        vector_db.update_effectiveness(chunk["id"], 0.7)
        
    return evaluation
```
