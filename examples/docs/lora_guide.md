# LoRA Fine-tuning Guide for Educational AI

This guide explains how to use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning language models specifically for educational applications in the UTTA project.

## Overview

LoRA is an efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining model performance. For educational applications, it's particularly valuable because it allows you to:
- Customize models for specific subjects or teaching styles
- Maintain quick iteration cycles for pedagogical improvements
- Scale to multiple educational domains cost-effectively
- Preserve base model knowledge while adding teaching expertise

## Getting Started

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install transformers peft datasets torch
```

2. Import necessary modules:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TrainingArguments
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training
from datasets import load_dataset
```

## Educational Data Preparation

### 1. Structure Your Training Data
```python
educational_dialogues = [
    {
        "instruction": "Explain the concept of photosynthesis to a middle school student",
        "context": "Teaching biology fundamentals",
        "response": "Think of photosynthesis like a plant's kitchen...",
        "metadata": {
            "subject": "Biology",
            "grade_level": "Middle School",
            "teaching_style": "Analogy-based"
        }
    }
]

# Convert to JSONL format
with open('education_data.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for dialogue in educational_dialogues:
        json.dump(dialogue, f)
        f.write('\n')
```

### 2. Load and Preprocess Data
```python
def preprocess_educational_data(examples):
    # Format for instruction tuning
    prompt = f"""### Instruction: {examples['instruction']}
### Context: {examples['context']}
### Response: {examples['response']}"""
    return {"text": prompt}

dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files='education_data.jsonl')
processed_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_educational_data)
```

## LoRA Configuration for Educational Models

```python
def setup_educational_lora(base_model_name, subject_area):
    # Load base model and tokenizer
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name)
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)

    # Configure LoRA specifically for educational use
    lora_config = LoraConfig(
        r=16,  # Higher rank for complex educational concepts
        lora_alpha=32,
        target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"],
        lora_dropout=0.05,
        bias="none",
        task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
        inference_mode=False,
        metadata={
            "subject": subject_area,
            "application": "education",
            "model_type": "instructional"
        }
    )

    # Prepare model for training
    model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
    model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
    
    return model, tokenizer
```

## Training Configuration

```python
def setup_educational_training(model, dataset, output_dir):
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        num_train_epochs=3,
        per_device_train_batch_size=4,
        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
        learning_rate=2e-4,
        fp16=True,
        logging_steps=10,
        evaluation_strategy="steps",
        eval_steps=100,
        save_strategy="steps",
        save_steps=100,
        warmup_steps=100,
        group_by_length=True,
        report_to="tensorboard",
    )
    
    return training_args
```

## Best Practices for Educational Fine-tuning

1. Data Quality and Diversity
   - Include various teaching styles (Socratic, direct instruction, inquiry-based)
   - Cover different student levels
   - Represent multiple subjects
   - Include common misconceptions and corrections

2. Model Architecture Considerations
   - Choose appropriate rank based on task complexity
   - Target attention layers for pedagogical patterns
   - Balance model size with response time

3. Training Process
   - Monitor educational metrics
   - Validate with real teaching scenarios
   - Test across different subjects
   - Evaluate pedagogical effectiveness

4. Evaluation Methods
   - Assess explanation clarity
   - Check for educational accuracy
   - Measure student engagement
   - Test for adaptability

## Example: Subject-Specific Tuning

```python
# Setup for mathematics education
math_model, tokenizer = setup_educational_lora(
    "base_model_name",
    subject_area="mathematics"
)

# Configure for step-by-step problem solving
math_lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=32,  # Higher rank for mathematical reasoning
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
    inference_mode=False,
    metadata={
        "subject": "mathematics",
        "teaching_style": "step_by_step",
        "grade_level": "high_school"
    }
)

# Training configuration
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="math_tutor_model",
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    evaluation_strategy="steps"
)
```
