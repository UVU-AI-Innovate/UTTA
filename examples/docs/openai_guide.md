# OpenAI Integration Guide for Educational Applications

This guide covers how to integrate and use OpenAI's models for educational purposes in the UTTA project, focusing on creating effective teaching assistants and educational content generators.

## Overview

OpenAI provides powerful language models through their API, which can be used for various educational AI applications. This guide covers:
- Creating intelligent teaching assistants
- Generating educational content
- Providing personalized feedback
- Assessing student understanding
- Fine-tuning models for specific subjects

## Getting Started

1. Install the OpenAI package:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

2. Set up your API key securely:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI

# Load API key from environment
load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
```

## Educational Applications

### 1. Intelligent Teaching Assistant
```python
def create_teaching_assistant(subject, grade_level):
    """Create a specialized teaching assistant for a specific subject and grade level."""
    
    system_prompt = f"""You are an expert {subject} teacher for {grade_level} students.
    - Use age-appropriate language and examples
    - Provide step-by-step explanations
    - Include real-world applications
    - Check for understanding frequently
    - Address common misconceptions"""
    
    return system_prompt

def get_educational_response(question, subject, grade_level, learning_style=None):
    """Generate educational responses with consideration for learning style."""
    
    system_prompt = create_teaching_assistant(subject, grade_level)
    
    style_instruction = ""
    if learning_style:
        style_instruction = f"Explain using a {learning_style} learning approach. "
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # Using GPT-4 for more nuanced educational responses
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{style_instruction}{question}"}
        ],
        temperature=0.7,  # Balanced between creativity and accuracy
        max_tokens=500,   # Appropriate length for educational explanations
        presence_penalty=0.6,  # Encourage diverse examples
        frequency_penalty=0.5   # Avoid repetitive language
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### 2. Student Progress Assessment
```python
def assess_student_response(student_answer, correct_answer, subject, grade_level):
    """Evaluate student responses and provide constructive feedback."""
    
    prompt = f"""Analyze this student response in {subject} ({grade_level} level):
    
    Question/Problem: {correct_answer['question']}
    Correct Answer: {correct_answer['solution']}
    Student's Answer: {student_answer}
    
    Provide:
    1. Accuracy assessment
    2. Identification of misconceptions
    3. Specific praise points
    4. Constructive feedback
    5. Suggested next steps"""
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an experienced educational assessor."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        temperature=0.3  # Lower temperature for more consistent assessment
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Fine-tuning for Education

### 1. Prepare Training Data
```python
def create_educational_dataset(subject_area):
    """Create JSONL dataset for fine-tuning."""
    
    training_data = [
        {
            "messages": [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful teaching assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "What is photosynthesis?"},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "Photosynthesis is like a plant's kitchen..."}
            ]
        },
        # Add more examples...
    ]
    
    # Save to JSONL file
    with open(f"{subject_area}_training.jsonl", "w") as f:
        for example in training_data:
            json.dump(example, f)
            f.write("\n")
    
    return f"{subject_area}_training.jsonl"

# Create and upload training file
training_file = client.files.create(
    file=open("biology_training.jsonl", "rb"),
    purpose="fine-tune"
)

# Start fine-tuning
job = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    training_file=training_file.id,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    hyperparameters={
        "n_epochs": 3,
        "learning_rate_multiplier": 1.6,
        "batch_size": 4
    }
)
```

### 2. Educational Content Generation
```python
def generate_lesson_materials(topic, grade_level, material_type):
    """Generate various educational materials."""
    
    prompts = {
        "lesson_plan": """Create a detailed lesson plan for {topic} at {grade_level} level:
        1. Learning objectives
        2. Key concepts
        3. Activities
        4. Assessment methods
        5. Materials needed""",
        
        "worksheet": """Design a worksheet for {topic} at {grade_level} level:
        1. Practice problems
        2. Application questions
        3. Critical thinking exercises
        4. Self-assessment section""",
        
        "quiz": """Create a quiz for {topic} at {grade_level} level:
        1. Multiple choice questions
        2. Short answer questions
        3. Problem-solving tasks
        4. Answer key with explanations"""
    }
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an experienced curriculum designer."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompts[material_type].format(
                topic=topic, 
                grade_level=grade_level
            )}
        ],
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
