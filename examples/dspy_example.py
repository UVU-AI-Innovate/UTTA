DSPy Optimization Example for Student Simulation

This example demonstrates prompt optimization using DSPy for creating a student simulation chatbot.
Key characteristics of this approach:
- No model weight updates (only prompt optimization)
- Very little training data needed (as few as 10-20 dialogue examples)
- No special infrastructure required
- Models multi-turn educational conversations with simulated student
- Incorporates realistic student behaviors like asking questions, showing partial understanding

API KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- This example requires a valid OpenAI API key.
- The key can be in standard format (sk-...) or project format (sk-proj-...)
- Set it in the .env file or as an environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
- You can get a key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
