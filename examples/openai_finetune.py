OpenAI Fine-Tuning Example for Teacher-Student Dialogue

This example demonstrates fine-tuning an OpenAI model for educational dialogues.
Key characteristics of this approach:
- Cloud-based training (no local GPU needed)
- API-based workflow (simple to use)
- Handles multi-turn teacher-student interactions
- Supports pedagogical techniques like scaffolding and Socratic questioning
- Training data contains complete dialogue sequences

It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Vaccines work by training this system without causing disease. They contain harmless pieces of the pathogen or weakened versions that trigger an immune response. Your body creates antibodies and memory cells, so if you encounter the real pathogen later, your immune system already knows how to fight it off quickly. Does that make sense?"},

            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you're on the right track! Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates - large pieces of the Earth's crust that float on the semi-liquid mantle beneath. These plates are constantly moving very slowly. Sometimes they get stuck against each other, building up pressure. When that pressure suddenly releases, the plates jerk into a new position, causing the ground to shake. This usually happens along fault lines, which are boundaries between tectonic plates. Does that explanation help you visualize why earthquakes happen?"}
