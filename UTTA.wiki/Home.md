Welcome to our comprehensive textbook on Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLMs)! This course provides a structured learning path from foundational concepts to advanced applications, using the Utah Teacher Training Assistant (UTTA) project as a practical case study throughout.

## üéØ Course Overview

This textbook is designed for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts who want to understand the complete GenAI stack. Starting with essential infrastructure and gradually progressing to sophisticated applications, you'll develop a deep understanding of how modern language models work and how to build practical systems with them.
