{"question": "What is photosynthesis?", "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. It converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen."}
{"question": "Who was Marie Curie?", "answer": "Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields, and the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris."}
{"question": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?", "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. It is expressed as a² + b² = c², where c is the length of the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides."}
{"question": "What caused World War I?", "answer": "World War I was caused by a complex set of factors including militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. The immediate trigger was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo in June 1914, which set off a chain of diplomatic and military decisions that led to the outbreak of war."}
{"question": "What is the water cycle?", "answer": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves processes such as evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff, which circulate water throughout Earth's systems."}
{"question": "What is the theory of relativity?", "answer": "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, published in 1905, deals with the physics of objects moving at constant speeds in a straight line, particularly at speeds approaching the speed of light. General relativity, published in 1915, is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime."}
{"question": "How does the human immune system work?", "answer": "The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens. It has two main components: the innate immune system, which provides immediate but non-specific defense, and the adaptive immune system, which develops specific responses to pathogens and creates immunological memory for faster responses to future infections."}
{"question": "What is the process of evolution?", "answer": "Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over successive generations. It occurs through natural selection, where traits that increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time. This process is driven by genetic variation, inheritance, high population growth rates, and differential survival and reproduction."}
{"question": "What are the main causes of climate change?", "answer": "The main causes of climate change are greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. Other contributors include deforestation, which reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, industrial processes, and agricultural practices like livestock farming and rice cultivation."}
{"question": "What is the structure of an atom?", "answer": "An atom consists of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons (positively charged particles) and neutrons (neutral particles), while electrons (negatively charged particles) orbit the nucleus in energy levels or shells. The number of protons determines the element, while the number of neutrons affects the isotope and the number of electrons influences the atom's chemical properties."}
