## Course Projects

Throughout this course, you'll complete practical projects that build on each other:

1. **Knowledge Base Explorer**: Create a simple tool to explore vector embeddings
2. **Educational Content Collection**: Design a content collection strategy
3. **Knowledge Processing System**: Build a pipeline for processing content
4. **Vector Search Implementation**: Implement efficient semantic search
5. **Interactive Training Application**: Create a complete RAG application
6. **Educational Chatbot**: Build a knowledge-enhanced conversational AI
7. **Development Environment**: Configure local and server environments for GenAI applications

## Getting Started

We recommend following the chapters in sequential order, as each builds upon concepts introduced in previous sections. Start with [Chapter 1: Introduction to Knowledge Bases for GenAI](Knowledge-Base-Overview) to begin your learning journey.
