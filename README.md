# Utah Elementary Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA)
## Second Grade Focus

An innovative educational training system integrated directly with Elementary Education program curriculum. This AI-powered platform allows education majors to practice and master teaching concepts through interactive simulations. Starting as a chatbot-based system (Phase 1), evolving to include voice interactions (Phase 2), and ultimately incorporating virtual reality experiences (Phase 3), UTAH-TTA provides a progressive learning environment where student teachers can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Each simulation is carefully crafted to align with specific teaching competencies and educational objectives from the teacher preparation program.
