# Utah Elementary Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA)
## Second Grade Focus

An innovative educational training system integrated directly with Elementary Education program curriculum. This AI-powered platform allows education majors to practice and master teaching concepts through interactive simulations. Starting as a chatbot-based system (Phase 1), evolving to include voice interactions (Phase 2), and ultimately incorporating virtual reality experiences (Phase 3), UTAH-TTA provides a progressive learning environment where student teachers can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Each simulation is carefully crafted to align with specific teaching competencies and educational objectives from the teacher preparation program.

## ðŸŒ¿ Branch Structure

This repository is organized into two main branches:

- `main` (current branch): Contains project documentation, architecture descriptions, and planning materials
- `phase-1-chatbot`: Implementation of Phase 1 - the chatbot-based teacher training system.

Future phases (voice interactions and VR experiences) will be developed in new branches as the project progresses.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation in this branch is organized as follows:

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started/   # Setup and initial guides
â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/      # System architecture documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ planning/          # Project planning and roadmap
â””â”€â”€ requirements/      # System requirements and specifications
```
