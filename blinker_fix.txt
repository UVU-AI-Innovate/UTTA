# Fix for the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'blinker'" error

This error occurs because the Streamlit package is missing a dependency. To fix it, run the following command in your terminal:

```
conda activate utta
pip install blinker
```

This will install the required blinker package in your conda environment.

Alternatively, you can add blinker to your requirements.txt file and reinstall all dependencies:

```
echo "blinker>=1.6.2" >> requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the blinker package, you should be able to run the Streamlit application without errors.
