# Data Collection Assignment  
## Team-Based Hierarchical Data Collection Project

## üéØ Project Overview
Teams will collaborate to collect and organize elementary education content, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive shared database.

**Before you begin:**  
Please review these essential resources to guide your work:
- **[Data Collection Guide for UTAH-TTA](../docs/data/collection_guide.md)**  
  This document details our standard processes, categorization, and quality standards for data collection.
- **[Web Scraping Techniques](../docs/web_scraping.md)**  
  If you are interested in automated data extraction, this guide introduces basic web scraping tools, practices, and ethical considerations.

## üìö Pre-Assignment Preparation

Before diving into the assignment, familiarize yourself with key concepts in research and data collection:

- **Research Fundamentals:**  
  Research involves defining clear questions and systematically seeking reliable information. Ask yourself:
  - What specific topics or questions related to elementary education are we addressing?
  - Which types of sources (e.g., state education sites, academic journals) best suit your needs?

- **Data Collection Approaches:**  
  You have two main options for gathering data:
  - **Manual Methods:** Search for credible sources, bookmark relevant pages, and record key details (URLs, dates, summaries, etc.).
  - **Automated Methods:** If you or a teammate is comfortable with programming, consider basic data mining or web scraping (refer to the Web Scraping Techniques guide).

- **Documentation & Organization:**  
  Consistent recording of your process is crucial. Not only does it help maintain a clear workflow, but it also aids in troubleshooting and future reference. Use shared spreadsheets or documents to log:
  - Source details
  - Extraction/discovery methods used
  - Any difficulties encountered

## üìã Team Responsibilities

### **Initial Setup**
- **Shared Directory:** Create the team's shared directory for all collected assets.
- **Communication:** Establish internal channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams) and agree on a team workflow.
- **Review Documentation:** Everyone should review both the [Data Collection Guide](../docs/data/collection_guide.md) and [Web Scraping Techniques](../docs/web_scraping.md) where applicable.

### **Data Collection**
- **Design Hierarchical Structure:**  
  Use the guidelines from the Data Collection Guide to develop an organized structure for the content.
- **Content Gathering:**  
  Decide on the method for collection:
  - **Manual Research:** Identify credible sources, record all necessary source details, and summarize content.
  - **Automated Extraction:** If using web scraping, follow the tutorials and ethical guidelines provided in our web scraping documentation.
  
- **Documentation:**  
  Clearly document your process, including:
  - Your chosen method (manual vs. automated)
  - Relevant URLs and source data
  - Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved

---

## ü§ù Inter-Team Collaboration

### **Phase 1: Individual Team Collection**
- Work independently on your assigned segments while maintaining clear records.
- Provide regular progress updates to the project coordinator.
- Participate in weekly cross-team check-ins to share insights and address challenges.

### **Phase 2: Database Integration**
- Present your team's data structure and content.
- Engage in collaborative sessions to standardize the content approaches.
- Help merge individual contributions into a cohesive, unified database.

---

## üìä Team Deliverables

### **Team Documentation**
- Detailed description of your internal workflow and team communication.
- Meeting minutes and records of decisions made during the process.

### **Collection Deliverables**
- **Hierarchy Design Document:** Outline the structure of your collected data.
- **Organized Content:** All content should be stored in the team's shared directory.
- **Navigation Guide:** A document detailing how to access and use the organized data.
- **Integration Preparation Report:** Summarize your data collection processes and any challenges in preparation for the database integration phase.

### Collection Metrics
Your final submission should include:
- **Quantity Report:** Total number of items collected per category
- **Coverage Analysis:** Distribution across subject areas
- **Quality Checklist:** Verification that all items meet the quality requirements
- **Time Log:** Documentation of hours spent on collection and organization

---

## üîÑ Integration Process
After the two-week collection period:
- Teams will present their organizational structures.
- Join collaborative sessions to standardize methods and structure.
- Contribute to the creation of a unified database structure.
- Follow through with systematic content migration into the integrated system.

## üåê Standard Alignment
To strengthen the alignment between your gathered content and our organizational standards, please consider the following:

1. **Refer to the Data Collection Guide**  
   - Revisit the [Data Collection Guide for UTAH-TTA](../docs/data/collection_guide.md) and verify that your items meet all established quality, age-appropriateness, and Utah Core Standards criteria.  
   - Double-check metadata completeness: source URLs, publication dates, learning objectives, etc.

2. **Leverage the Web Scraping Techniques**  
   - If automated scraping was used at any stage, ensure you followed the [Web Scraping Techniques](../docs/web_scraping.md) document closely, paying particular attention to the legal compliance and ethical constraints (rate-limiting, respecting ``robots.txt``, etc.).  
   - Incorporate relevant scripts or code snippets in your final submission to demonstrate how data was responsibly captured.

3. **Use a Consistent Template**  
   - When dealing with lesson plans, activities, or assessments, apply a uniform structure: title, grade level, subject area, relevant standard code (e.g., 2.MD.1), and a short summary.  
   - Following the "Scenario Template" or "Interaction Template" in the guide (where applicable) promotes a cohesive data set across all teams.

4. **Conduct Periodic Self-Audits**  
   - At least once per week, perform a quick rubric-based review: Are all items well-documented and properly aligned with Grade 2 curriculum standards?  
   - If you identify gaps (e.g., incomplete metadata, unclear alignment), correct them before the final integration phase.

5. **Document All Changes and Rationale**  
   - Keep records of any modifications made to your collection strategy or structure, including code changes in web scraping tools.  
   - Provide short notes or comments explaining why each modification was necessary for standard alignment.

By following these steps, your team will ensure that all data complies with UTAH-TTA standards and is ready for a smooth integration into the unified database.

## üìä Collection Requirements

### Quantity Guidelines
Each team should aim to collect:
- **Core Educational Content:** 15-20 unique items
  - 5-7 lesson plans
  - 5-7 classroom activities
  - 5-6 assessment materials

### Quality Requirements
Each collected item must include:
- Complete metadata (source, date, grade level, subject area)
- Clear alignment with Utah Core Standards
- Age-appropriate content for 2nd grade
- Proper attribution and licensing information

### Content Distribution
Balance your collection across these subject areas:
- Mathematics (25-30%)
- Language Arts (25-30%)
- Science (20-25%)
- Social Studies (20-25%)

### Time Investment Guidelines
- Expected time: 10-12 hours per team member over 2 weeks
- Recommended daily collection: 1-2 items per team member
- Team coordination: 2-3 hours per week
